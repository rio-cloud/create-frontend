# How to change the graphics

The *.drawio files are the source of truth for the *.svg graphics. You can use
the [draw.io web editor](https://www.drawio.com/) to change them. Save the
changed *.drawio file in this folder and also export an *.svg to this folder.
Do not embed the fonts to keep the *.svg images small.
